When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

to access it from any place or any device and to share the updated files with my team work that work also on it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

to check first my commit before push it to github.
